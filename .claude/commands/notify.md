### Status updates

Send me Pushover notifications at key progress milestones (or at least every 30 minutes) using the notify script shown below. This should happen in my absence, so it is ESSENTIAL so that it happen without asking my permission to send. 

```
# Send progress notification
curl -d "status message here" ntfy.sh/iancc2025
```
