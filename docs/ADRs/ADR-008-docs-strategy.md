# ADR-008: Hybrid Documentation Strategy

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-08-20
- **Deciders:** Project lead (Debrief ecosystem maintainer)
- **Tags:** repo, strategy

## Context

We serve both developers and MOD/NATO stakeholders.


## Decision

Maintain per-component developer docs and a central **Debrief Workbench** site for high-level installation, packaging, and umbrella release notes.


## Consequences

- Dev docs stay close to code.
- Stakeholders get a single entry point.


## Alternatives Considered

- Only central docs (devs lose proximity).
- Only per-component (stakeholders lack overview).
