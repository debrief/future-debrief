# ADR-008: Documentation Strategy

## Context
Different audiences: developers need detailed component docs, MOD/NATO stakeholders need central overview.

## Decision
Adopt a **hybrid documentation strategy**:
- Per-component READMEs and local docs for developers.  
- Central "Debrief Workbench" docs site for stakeholders and umbrella releases.  

## Rationale
- Keeps developer docs lightweight and close to code.  
- Provides polished, centralised entry point for MOD/NATO users.  

## Consequences
- Requires maintaining both per-component and central docs.  
- Ensures stakeholders and developers both have suitable documentation.
