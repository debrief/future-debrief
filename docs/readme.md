# Debrief Documentation

This `docs` folder contains guidance, architecture decision records (ADRs), and ecosystem-wide documentation that cross-cut all components of the Debrief ecosystem. It is the primary source for:
- Cross-cutting design decisions
- Onboarding and governance guidance
- Packaging, release, and compliance strategies

See the [ADRs Index](./ADRs/index.md) for a summary of all architecture decisions.
