# APM Memory Bank - Debrief VS Code Extension Project

This file contains the cumulative memory bank for the Debrief VS Code Extension project, tracking all significant work performed by agents within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework.

---
**Agent:** Implementation Agent (Task 1.1)
**Task Reference:** Phase 1: VS Code Extension Scaffolding

**Summary:**
Successfully completed VS Code extension scaffolding with sidebar container and placeholder views, creating a functional foundation for future postMessage and UI logic.

**Details:**
- Examined and continued from existing yo-generated VS Code extension structure
- Cleaned up boilerplate code by removing sample "Hello World" command from extension.ts
- Created three new provider classes: DebriefSidebar.ts (webview container), OutlineViewProvider.ts (tree view for document structure), and TimelineViewProvider.ts (tree view for analysis timeline)
- Configured extension manifest in package.json with proper viewsContainers and views registration
- Registered "Debrief" activity bar container with ID "debrief" and placeholder icon reference
- Added two views under the debrief container: "debriefOutline" (Outline) and "debriefTimeline" (Timeline)
- Created media directory and placeholder SVG icon (debrief-icon.svg) for the activity bar
- Added refresh commands for both views with proper menu integration

**Output/Result:**
```typescript
// Updated extension.ts with proper provider registration
import * as vscode from 'vscode';
import { DebriefSidebar } from './DebriefSidebar';
import { OutlineViewProvider } from './OutlineViewProvider';
import { TimelineViewProvider } from './TimelineViewProvider';

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
	console.log('Debrief VS Code extension is now active!');

	const debriefSidebar = new DebriefSidebar(context);
	const outlineProvider = new OutlineViewProvider();
	const timelineProvider = new TimelineViewProvider();

	vscode.window.registerTreeDataProvider('debriefOutline', outlineProvider);
	vscode.window.registerTreeDataProvider('debriefTimeline', timelineProvider);

	context.subscriptions.push(
		vscode.commands.registerCommand('debriefOutline.refresh', () => outlineProvider.refresh()),
		vscode.commands.registerCommand('debriefTimeline.refresh', () => timelineProvider.refresh())
	);
}
```

Extension compiles successfully (yarn compile) and passes linting (yarn lint) without errors. Directory structure now includes:
- /src/DebriefSidebar.ts - Webview provider class
- /src/OutlineViewProvider.ts - Tree data provider for outline view  
- /src/TimelineViewProvider.ts - Tree data provider for timeline view
- /media/debrief-icon.svg - Activity bar icon placeholder

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None

**Next Steps:**
Ready for Phase 2: React Setup for Outline and Timeline views (Task 2.1). Extension foundation is established and can be loaded in VS Code development mode.
