# üö¢ Debrief VS Code Extension Demo

Welcome to the **Debrief VS Code Extension** demonstration environment! This Codespace provides a zero-install, browser-based way to explore the capabilities of our advanced maritime analysis tool.

## üéØ What You'll Experience

The Debrief extension transforms VS Code into a powerful platform for analyzing maritime and military track data, featuring:

- **Interactive Map Visualization** - View tracks on dynamic maps with Leaflet integration
- **Timeline Analysis** - Navigate temporal data with intuitive time controls
- **GeoJSON Support** - Native rendering of geographic data formats
- **Real-time Editing** - Modify and visualize data changes instantly

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Launch the Extension Development Environment
The Debrief extension runs in development mode in this Codespace. To start it:

1. **Wait** for the Codespace to finish initializing (yarn install and compile will run automatically)
2. **Press** `F5` or use the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`) and type "Debug: Start Debugging"
3. **Select** "Run Extension" when prompted
4. A new VS Code window will open - this is the **Extension Development Host**
5. **Look** for the **Debrief** activity bar icon (üîç) on the left sidebar of the new window

### Step 2: Open Sample Files
We've provided three demonstration files in this workspace:

1. **`large-sample.plot.json`** - Maritime vessel tracks with rich temporal data
   - Click to open and see the interactive map editor
   - Contains multiple vessel tracks (VAN GALEN and others)
   - Demonstrates real-time geographic visualization

2. **`boat1.rep`** - Naval vessel NELSON track data in Debrief format
   - Shows traditional .rep file format support
   - Contains position, course, and speed data

3. **`boat2.rep`** - Naval vessel COLLINGWOOD track data
   - Demonstrates multi-vessel scenario analysis
   - Shows different operational patterns

### Step 3: Explore Key Features

#### üó∫Ô∏è Map Visualization
1. **Open** `large-sample.plot.json` by clicking on it
2. **Observe** the custom editor opens with an interactive map
3. **Interact** with the map:
   - Pan and zoom to explore the area
   - Click on track points to see detailed information
   - Use mouse wheel to zoom in/out

#### ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline Controls
1. **Look** at the Debrief sidebar (left panel)
2. **Find** the "Time Controller" section
3. **Explore** temporal navigation features
4. **Notice** how the timeline reflects the data from open files

#### üìä Outline View
1. **Check** the "Outline" section in the Debrief sidebar
2. **See** the document structure and metadata
3. **Observe** real-time updates as you interact with files

### Step 4: Try Advanced Features

#### Multi-File Analysis
- Open multiple .plot.json and .rep files simultaneously
- Switch between tabs to compare different scenarios
- Notice how the sidebar updates to reflect the active file

#### Data Interaction
- **Hover** over track points to see tooltips
- **Click** on features to open detailed popup information
- **Pan** the map to follow vessel movements

#### Theme Integration
- Try switching VS Code themes (Ctrl/Cmd + K, T)
- Notice how the extension adapts to light/dark themes
- Observe consistent styling across all components

## üìã What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Key Capabilities to Evaluate

- [ ] **Map Loading**: Does the interactive map display correctly?
- [ ] **Data Rendering**: Are vessel tracks visible and accurate?
- [ ] **Interactivity**: Can you click, pan, and zoom the map?
- [ ] **Sidebar Integration**: Do the Timeline and Outline panels show relevant data?
- [ ] **Theme Consistency**: Does the extension match VS Code's appearance?
- [ ] **Performance**: Is the interface responsive and smooth?
- [ ] **File Handling**: Do different file types (.plot.json, .rep) open correctly?

### üîç Technical Features

- **Custom Editor**: `.plot.json` files open in specialized map editor
- **GeoJSON Support**: Native rendering of geographic feature collections
- **Leaflet Integration**: Professional mapping with OpenStreetMap tiles
- **Real-time Updates**: Live communication between editor and sidebar
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for invalid or malformed data
