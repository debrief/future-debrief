### Running the Extension

To run the extension in development mode with hot-reloading:

   This opens a new VS Code window with your extension loaded.

### Hot Reloading During Development

The extension is configured for efficient development workflow:

1. **Make code changes** in the `src/` directory
2. **Watch for compilation** - the `yarn watch` process will automatically recompile
3. **Reload the extension** - Press `Cmd+R` (macOS) or `Ctrl+R` (Windows/Linux) in the Extension Development Host window to reload with your changes

The extension will automatically refresh its views when reloaded.
