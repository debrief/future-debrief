# Implementation Plan
## Codespace Extension Demonstrator

### Phase 1: Project Foundation

#### Step 1: Initialize Extension Project Structure
**Objective:** Set up basic VS Code extension project with TypeScript configuration

**Tasks:**
- Create `package.json` with extension manifest
- Configure `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript compilation
- Set up `src/` directory structure
- Install required dependencies (`@types/vscode`, `typescript`)

**Test Criteria:**
- `npm install` runs without errors
- TypeScript compilation works (`tsc -p ./`)
- VS Code recognizes project as extension (F5 opens Extension Development Host)

**Expected Output:** Functioning TypeScript project that can be loaded as VS Code extension

---

#### Step 2: Implement Basic Extension Activation
**Objective:** Create minimal extension that activates and logs to console

**Tasks:**
- Create `src/extension.ts` with `activate()` and `deactivate()` functions
- Add console logging to verify activation
- Configure extension activation events in `package.json`

**Test Criteria:**
- Extension loads in Extension Development Host
- Console shows activation message in Developer Tools
- No compilation or runtime errors

**Expected Output:** Working extension that activates successfully

---

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Implementation

#### Step 3: Add Command Palette Integration
**Objective:** Implement "Hello World" command accessible via Command Palette

**Tasks:**
- Register command `codespace-extension.helloWorld` in `package.json`
- Implement command handler in `extension.ts`
- Add information message display using `vscode.window.showInformationMessage()`

**Test Criteria:**
- Command appears in Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P)
- Executing command shows "Hello World" information message
- Command works in both Extension Development Host and packaged extension

**Expected Output:** Functional command that users can execute from palette

---

#### Step 4: Implement Activation Notification
**Objective:** Display welcome notification when extension activates

**Tasks:**
- Add notification message to `activate()` function
- Use `vscode.window.showInformationMessage()` for user-friendly notification
- Ensure notification doesn't interfere with extension functionality

**Test Criteria:**
- Notification appears immediately when extension activates
- Message is clear and informative
- Notification doesn't block other extension operations

**Expected Output:** User sees confirmation that extension has loaded

---

#### Step 5: Create Custom View Panel
**Objective:** Add custom view panel with "Hello World" content

**Tasks:**
- Define view contribution in `package.json` (views, viewsContainers)
- Create `WebviewProvider` class for custom panel content
- Register webview provider in `activate()` function
- Design simple HTML content for the panel

**Test Criteria:**
- Custom view appears in Activity Bar
- Panel displays "Hello World" content when opened
- Panel refreshes and updates correctly
- Works in both development and packaged modes

**Expected Output:** Custom panel accessible from Activity Bar showing Hello World content

---

### Phase 3: Development Environment Setup

#### Step 6: Create Devcontainer Configuration
**Objective:** Set up GitHub Codespaces development environment

**Tasks:**
- Create `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
- Configure base image (VS Code development container)
- Pre-install essential extensions (TypeScript, ESLint)
- Set up Node.js environment and dependencies
- Configure VS Code settings for extension development

**Test Criteria:**
- Codespace launches successfully from repository
- All required extensions are pre-installed
- Extension development workflow works in Codespace
- `npm install` and `tsc` commands work correctly

**Expected Output:** Fully configured development environment accessible via Codespaces

---

#### Step 7: Add Build Scripts
**Objective:** Implement scripts for building the extension

**Tasks:**
- Add `vscode:prepublish`, `compile`, and `watch` scripts to `package.json`
- Configure TypeScript compilation to `out/` directory
- Ensure build process works in development workflow

**Test Criteria:**
- `npm run compile` builds extension without errors
- `npm run watch` monitors file changes and recompiles
- Built extension works identically to source version

**Expected Output:** Automated build process for development workflow

---

### Phase 4: GitHub Integration

#### Step 8: Configure GitHub Actions Workflow
**Objective:** Set up automated Codespace preview for Pull Requests

**Tasks:**
- Create `.github/workflows/codespace-preview.yml`
- Configure workflow to trigger on PR creation and updates
- Set up job to enable Codespaces for the PR branch
- Add status checks and environment setup

**Test Criteria:**
- Workflow triggers automatically on PR creation
- Workflow triggers on PR updates/pushes
- Codespace link becomes available in PR interface
- Workflow completes without errors

**Expected Output:** Automated workflow enabling Codespace preview for every PR

---

#### Step 9: Test PR Preview Functionality
**Objective:** Verify end-to-end PR preview workflow

**Tasks:**
- Create test PR with extension modifications
- Verify Codespace launches from PR
- Test all extension functionality in PR Codespace
- Validate that changes are reflected in preview environment

**Test Criteria:**
- Codespace launches successfully from PR
- Extension functions correctly in PR Codespace
- All features (command, notification, panel) work as expected
- Changes made in PR are visible in Codespace preview

**Expected Output:** Fully functional PR preview system

---

### Phase 5: Documentation and Validation

#### Step 10: Create User Documentation
**Objective:** Document setup and usage for team members

**Tasks:**
- Create `README.md` with setup instructions
- Document extension features and usage
- Provide step-by-step guide for PR preview workflow
- Add troubleshooting section

**Test Criteria:**
- Team member can follow README to set up local development
- Instructions for creating PR previews are clear and complete
- Troubleshooting section addresses common issues

**Expected Output:** Complete documentation enabling team adoption

---

#### Step 11: End-to-End Testing and Validation
**Objective:** Validate complete workflow meets all requirements

**Tasks:**
- Test extension in multiple environments (local, Codespace, PR preview)
- Verify all acceptance criteria from requirements document
- Perform user acceptance testing with team member
- Address any issues or gaps discovered

**Test Criteria:**
- All functional requirements are met
- Extension works identically across all environments
- GitHub Actions workflow is reliable and consistent
- Team can successfully replicate the entire workflow

**Expected Output:** Production-ready demonstration project meeting all requirements

---

### Phase 6: Packaging and Distribution

#### Step 12: Add Extension Packaging
**Objective:** Set up extension packaging for distribution

**Tasks:**
- Add `.vscodeignore` file for packaging
- Test extension packaging with `vsce package`
- Configure packaging scripts in `package.json`
- Document packaging process

**Test Criteria:**
- `vsce package` creates .vsix file without errors
- Packaged extension installs and functions correctly
- No unnecessary files included in package
- Package size is reasonable

**Expected Output:** Distributable extension package

---

### Dependencies and Prerequisites

**Sequential Dependencies:**
- Steps 1-2 must complete before Step 3
- Step 3 must complete before Steps 4-5 (can run in parallel)
- Step 6 should complete before Step 8
- Steps 7-8 can run in parallel after Step 6
- Step 9 requires completion of Steps 6-8
- Steps 10-11 require completion of all previous steps
- Step 12 can be completed independently after core functionality is working

**External Dependencies:**
- GitHub repository with Codespaces enabled
- Node.js and npm installed in development environment
- VS Code with extension development capabilities
- GitHub Actions permissions for repository

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Each step includes specific test criteria to validate completion
- Steps are designed to be reversible if issues are discovered
- Documentation is created progressively to capture knowledge
- Testing occurs at multiple points to catch issues early
