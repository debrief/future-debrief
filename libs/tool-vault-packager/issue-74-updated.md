# APM Task Assignment: Playwright Testing Implementation for ToolVault SPA Integration

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

**Introduction:** You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the ToolVault SPA Integration Testing project.

**Your Role:** As an Implementation Agent, you are responsible for implementing comprehensive Playwright test suites that verify both packaging integrity and end-to-end functionality of the ToolVault SPA when served from development and packaged (.pyz) distribution modes.

**Workflow:** You will receive detailed task assignments and must complete them according to the specifications while maintaining comprehensive documentation in the Memory Bank for future reference.

## 2. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment addresses Issue #74 - implementing comprehensive Playwright testing for ToolVault SPA Integration to ensure robust packaging verification and end-to-end functionality testing.

**Objective:** Create a comprehensive Playwright test suite that verifies both the packaging integrity and end-to-end functionality of the ToolVault SPA when served from both development environment and packaged (.pyz) distribution, focusing on the word-count tool as a representative example.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

### 1. Test Environment Setup and Configuration
- [x] Install and configure Playwright testing framework
- [x] Set up test configuration for both .pyz packaged distribution mode and development mode
- [x] Create unified test suite with configuration flags to handle both environments
- [x] Configure test data management using existing word-count tool and simple-text sample
- **Guidance:** Use Playwright's configuration file to handle multiple test environments with conditional setup based on environment variables

### 2. Package Structure Verification Tests
- [x] Implement tests to verify presence of `debug-package-contents` folder
- [x] Create validation test for `index.json` existence in root folder
- [x] Verify `word-count` sub-folder structure containing required files:
  - `tool.json` validation
  - Sample input files verification  
  - Metadata files validation as documented in package `README.md`
- **Guidance:** Use file system assertions and JSON schema validation where applicable

### 3. Server Integration Testing Implementation
- [x] Create tests for Python server startup verification
- [x] Implement Vite frontend startup verification tests
- [x] Verify bidirectional communication between services
- [x] Add proper async handling for server startup timing
- **Guidance:** Implement proper wait conditions and health checks for both services before proceeding with integration tests

### 4. UI Functional Testing Implementation (Word-Count Tool Focus)
- [x] Verify word-count method appears correctly in tool list
- [x] Implement navigation test to word-count tool interface
- [x] Create test for git history display validation (non-null verification)
- [x] Verify source-code block display on `Code` tab (non-null verification)
- [x] Test Execute tab functionality:
  - Verify minimum 3 items in samples dropdown
  - Select `simple-text` from samples dropdown
  - Execute word-count operation and verify result equals `2`
- **Guidance:** Use Playwright's page object pattern for maintainable UI interaction tests and implement proper wait strategies for async operations

### 5. Test Structure and Modularity Implementation  
- [x] Create modular test file organization by functionality:
  - Structure verification tests module
  - UI interaction tests module
  - Integration tests module for SPA-Flask communication
- [x] Implement shared utilities for common setup/teardown operations
- [x] Create proper test data management and cleanup procedures
- **Guidance:** Follow Playwright best practices for test organization and implement proper test isolation

### 6. CI/CD Integration and Documentation
- [x] Integrate test suite into existing build/CI pipeline
- [x] Create comprehensive test documentation including:
  - Test execution instructions for both modes
  - Test coverage reporting
  - Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [x] Implement test result reporting with clear feedback on packaging success/failure
- **Guidance:** Ensure tests can run in both local development and CI environments with appropriate configuration

## 3. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Define Success:** Successful completion requires:
- Playwright test suite running successfully against both .pyz and development modes ✅
- All package structure validations passing consistently ✅
- UI navigation and interaction tests executing reliably ✅
- Word-count tool execution producing expected result (2) ✅
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline functioning properly ✅

**Specify Deliverables:**
- Complete Playwright test suite with modular structure ✅
- Test configuration files for both deployment modes ✅
- Comprehensive test documentation ✅
- CI/CD integration scripts ✅
- Test execution and result reporting system ✅

**Format:** Tests should follow Playwright TypeScript patterns with proper async/await handling and page object models where appropriate.

## 4. Memory Bank Logging Instructions (Mandatory)

Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's [Memory_Bank.md](../../Memory_Bank.md) file.

**Format Adherence:** Adhere strictly to the established logging format. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to Issue #74 and this task assignment
- Clear description of the test implementation approach and architecture
- Code snippets for key test utilities and configuration
- Any challenges encountered during Playwright setup or test implementation
- Confirmation of successful test execution against both deployment modes
- Integration details with existing CI/CD pipeline

## 5. Clarification Instruction

If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding. This includes questions about:
- Specific ToolVault API endpoints or data structures
- Expected test coverage thresholds
- Integration requirements with existing build processes
- Environment setup dependencies
